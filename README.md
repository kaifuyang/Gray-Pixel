Source codes of the Gray pixel detection method reported in  
"KF Yang, SB Gao, YJ Li*. Efficient Illuminant Estimation for Color Constancy Using Grey Pixels. CVPR, 2015".

We systematically developed Gray-pixel methods for illuminant estimation. This included proposing the gray-pixel hypothesis, validating it, and developing algorithms for color constancy.

Source codes of the Robust Gray pixel detection reported in
C Cheng, KF Yang*, XM Wan, LLH Chen, YJ Li. Nighttime Color Constancy Using Robust Gray Pixels. JOSA A, 2024.
  
We develop a robust gray pixel (RGP) detection method by carefully designing the computation of illuminant-invariant measures from a given color-biased nighttime image.
In addition, to evaluate the proposed method, a new dataset that contains 513 nighttime images and corresponding ground-truth illuminants was collected [[NCC dataset]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yangkaifu/nighttime-color-constancy).
