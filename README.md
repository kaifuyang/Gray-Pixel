We develop a robust gray pixel (RGP) detection method by carefully designing the computation of illuminant-invariant measures from a given color-biased nighttime image.
In addition, to evaluate the proposed method, a new dataset that contains 513 nighttime images and corresponding ground-truth illuminants was collected [NCC dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
